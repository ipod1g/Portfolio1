# Process

---

### Initial

-  Imported package from magnetic buttons demo website
-  Used template builder to get a vague idea for the layout
-  Intended to make a minimal portfolio website
-  Tried to apply semantic HTML tagging

### Problems

-  Faced difficulties when trying to digest the magnetic buttons and applying hover effect on all buttons since I learned JavaScript on the go
-  Responsive design required me to wholly reconstruct and change the initial CSS units to relative units
-  Received negative feedbacks about the initial UI experience

### Lessons

-  Familiarized with JavaScript and constructing responsive design
-  Deployment process undergone with use of npm
-  VS Code upgraded with many more useful extensions for future use
   -  Utilized live-share to brainstorm with my friend on some scripts
-  Actively taking in feedbacks for better end product

# Future implementation

---

-  Future work may add pop-up screen using react / framer.motion instead of redirecting to another link
